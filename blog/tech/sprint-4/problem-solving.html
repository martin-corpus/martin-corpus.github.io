          <h1>1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</h1>
          <ul class="question">
            <li>What was the problem?</li>
              <p>
                I wrote a function where there was a return command inside the function. 
                It was soon followed by a console.log(function()).
                When my output was produced, the result was doubled.  
              </p>
            <li>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</li>
              <p>
                I first checked the error messages which told me the result was doubled.
                I started playing around with my code to fix the issue with no avail. 
                I then went to google to check where I made a mistake but still nothing.
                As a result, I ended up asking my facilitator's help.
              </p>
            <li>How did you feel throughout the process?</li>
              <p>
                As with any problem, I was determined to find out what went wrong.
                When I was consuming too much time, I knew I needed someone's help.
                And when that help solved the issue, I felt very stupid finding out 
                the issue was so minor.
              </p>
            <li>What did you learn?</li>
              <p>
                I learned that I should take my time studying the root cause of the problem.
                I am too focused at times to concentrate on my coding that I overlook simple things.
              </p>
          </ul>
        </section>
        

        <section>
          <h1>2. Elegantly solved a problem.</h1>
          <ul class="question">
            <li>What was the problem?</li>
              <p>
                I had to take a string then make the first letter of every word capitalized.
              </p>
            <li>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</li>
              <p>
                I only used google. I researched how to solve the problem and ended up learning
                new methods. I had to put them all together for the code to work.
              </p>
            <li>How did you feel throughout the process?</li>
              <p>
                At first I was overwhelmed. So many links will show you how to do it but
                sometimes it just gets more confusing when you have multiple sources.
                To add to this, I had to research further because new methods were coming up.
                It did feel good when I was able to peice them all together.
              </p>
            <li>What did you learn?</li>
              <p>
                I learned that it is through the process of helping yourself you learn most.
                I also learned that with enough time, I will almost always find a solution. Unfortuantely,
                time is always limited. 
              </p>

          <h1>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h1>
          <ul class="question">
            <li>Pseudocode</li>
              <p>
                I am confident with Pseudocode. I forget at times to use them though. During the Javascript Kata
                I didn't use them at all because the npm test was clearly stating the steps I had to do.
              </p>
            <li>Trying something</li>
              <p>
                This is something I end up doing all the time. The endless trial and errors are my forte.
              </p>
            <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
              <p>
                I only do this when I take a quick break from the computer. I talk to myself inside my head.
              </p>
            <li>Reading error messages</li>
              <p>
                I am not confident as much as I want to be but I am slowly understanding the messages now.
              </p>
            <li>Console.logging</li>
              <p>
                After my minor mistake mentioned earlier, I don't think I am that confident.
                I might be confusing it with the return command at times.
              </p>
            <li>Googling</li>
              <p>
                Similar to trying something new, this is one of the things I feel confident with.
              </p>
            <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
              <p>
                When I am spending too much time trying to solve a problem even when using all the previous techniques,
                then yes I am confident to ask for help.
              </p>
            <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
              <p>
                Same as asking my peers for help.
              </p>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
              <p>
                This I need to practice more. I need to do small constant changes as often as I can until it becomes
                second nature.
              </p>
