          <h1>Research Neuroplasticity</h1>
          <h2>1. Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
          <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people in many ways. The concept of a challenge changes in one's point of view. 
            Knowing the fact that the brain is always changing and adapting, people can change their approach in tackling these challenges. It gives them the benefit of the doubt that anything can be achieved in time. This mindset can give more motivation in facing challenges and more importantly, taking away self-doubt that they are unachievable.</p>
          <h2>2. Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>
          <p>I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity when I do my studies. I did not know it was called that before I saw the video but I have been doing it for a long time. Every morning when I have my first cup of coffee, I always imagine the possibilites that my learning challenges will produce. I always remind myself that the day will come when all the information I am taking will be a common day knowledge to me. This puts everything in perspective and pushes me to work hard and endure the grind.</p>
          <h2>3. What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
          <p>Practice! When I have free time, I play around with my VS coder to make it a common habit. When I get too bored with it, I go back to the optional video resources and try to get used to the terminologies. </p>
          <h2>4. Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h2>
          <p>I found this <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/organ-systems/neural-synapses/v/neuroplasticity" class="link">link</a> interesting. It dicusses how the structure of the brain changes from a constant specific stimulus. It backs up the thought we all know that practice only makes for improvement.</p>

          <h1>Research Growth Mindset</h1>
          <h2>1. Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h2>
          <p>Growth Mindset is the belief that our intelligence and talents can be improved through effort and actions. As oppose to Fixed Mindset wherin the belief of intelligence and talent are innate. This is relevant to everyday life because some people have the misconception that their capabilities have limitation. This disables them to achieve their true potential. Consequently, this will also affect the quality of life they can have</p>
          <h2>2. In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
          <p>It did not surprise me to hear about growth mindset. I dont' recall if I have come across the term before but I always believed in the science that our potential is not inherited but worked for.</p>
          <h2>3. How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
          <p>I can integrate growth mindset in my learning journey by focusing on the process rather than the intended result. Result-oriented goals are usually time-based and can end up in burnout if not achieved. On the other hand, process-oriented goals focus on progress increments. Keeping that in mind, I want to give more attention on how far I have come regardless of the pace. All I need is consistency of moving forward. </p>
          <h2>4. Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h2>
          <p>This is a <a href="https://youtu.be/JC82Il2cjqA" class="link">link</a> that I adore. It shows the basic concept that we can learn anything. The video is not only uplifting but shows that our potential is limitless.</p>

          <h1>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h1>
          <h2>1. Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>
          <p>Looking back on my learning plan, there is nothing I would change. I did mention in it that the only commitment I focus on is time and to stick to a daily learning routine. It coincides with this core topic because it supports the idea of constant practice and stimulation to achieve my goals.</p>
