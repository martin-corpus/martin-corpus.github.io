          <h1>1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h1>
          <p>
            To be quite honest, during the core learning, I didn't learn anything new about myself or my ego. 
            I've studied extensively in the past, and what I already understand about myself is accurate. 
            It did, however, confirm my character as I know it to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy difficulties, to start. When I have to wait for the solution or cannot find it, it concerns me. 
            Knowing the answer is more important than bragging or demonstrating my ability to complete the task. 
            Even if someone shows it to me, I don't mind as long as I can resolve the situation mentally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, I'm very careful with my time. I'll put in a lot of effort to achieve a personal goal that I 
            set for myself to complete a particular challenge. Naturally, I had already factored work time for 
            breaks and personal time while calculating this. But I don't mind going above and above to make it 
            happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            And last, I enjoy my independence. I enjoy having the freedom to discuss concepts with myself as I 
            mull over a problem. This might discourage some individuals from trying to plan with me because I 
            have a tendency to think tangentially hehe.

          <h1>2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
          <p>
            In learning and programming, values, empathy, and self-awareness all play significant roles. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Values: Our behaviour and decision-making are shaped by our values, which serve as our guiding 
            principles. Values like diligence, reliability, cognizance, and precision are crucial to 
            performing well in both learning and programming. For instance, if a programmer values the 
            importance of writing clear and readable code, they will prioritize writing code that is easy 
            for others to understand and maintain. Additionally, when working in a team, values like respect, 
            cooperation, and teamwork are critical since they foster a healthy workplace atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
            Empathy: The capacity to comprehend and empathise with the emotions of others. Empathy is 
            essential in programming to satisfy end-user needs. When creating software, a programmer who 
            practises empathy will take the user's wants, preferences, and constraints into account. 
            Additionally, empathy is crucial in a programming team because it promotes understanding and 
            cooperation among team members, improving collaboration and problem-solving efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The capacity to recognise and comprehend one's own thoughts, feelings, and behaviours is known 
            as self-awareness. Programmers that are self-aware are better able to identify their areas of 
            strength and weakness and endeavour to strengthen those areas of their craft. For instance, 
            a self-aware programmer would look for more training or mentorship to advance their programming 
            abilities. A programming team needs people that are self-aware because it helps them see their 
            own prejudices and limits and collaborate to get past them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, values, empathy, and self-awareness are significant elements that affect how well 
            people learn and code. Programmers can create software that is of high quality, 
            satisfies end-user needs, and promotes Ð° happy and productive work environment by giving priority 
            to these characteristics.

          <h1>3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
          <p>
            The frequency of core learning surprised me the most.  Every sprint has a core topic that is 
            covered every week. I don't object to it. I like that this is covered in the curriculum. 
            I just didn't think the course would include it. However, I can see why it is necessary for 
            our schooling now.

          <h1>4. What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
          <p>
            The core learning was rewarding and difficult for me as a student. It was occasionally 
            challenging for me to identify places where I needed to grow and concentrate on improving my 
            self-awareness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another challenging aspect of the core learning was learning to integrate my values into my 
            technical skills. This required me to approach programming from a different perspective, where 
            I was not only focused on the technical aspects of the code, but also on how the code would affect 
            others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the core learning forced me to think beyond programming's technical aspects and 
            examine the wider implications of my work. It forced me to consider critically how I could 
            apply my programming expertise to bring about change. Even though this kind of learning was 
            difficult, it was also immensely rewarding and has changed the way I view my work as a programmer.

          <h1>5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on 
            core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h1>
          <p>
            In web development Bootcamp classes, I think programming schools are spending more time 
            concentrating on core learning because technical abilities alone do not produce a great programmer. 
            While having strong technical skills is unquestionably essential, a programmer's success also 
            depends on their interpersonal skills, communication skills, and awareness of how their job 
            affects society.
          </p>
          <p>
            By incorporating core learning into a web development Bootcamp course, programming schools are 
            helping students develop the critical skills necessary to become well-rounded and effective 
            programmers who can work collaboratively, communicate effectively, and create solutions that 
            are beneficial for everyone.
          </p>

          <h1>6. Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
            Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>
          <p>
            No, I don't feel like the time I spent studying core learning was a waste of time. In fact, I 
            believe that the time spent on core learning was just as important as the time spent practicing 
            programming. Technical skills are important, but they are not the only factor that contributes to 
            success as a programmer. Core learning helps students become a well-rounded and effective programmer 
            which I want to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, core learning enables students to recognise their own prejudices to develop a more 
            diverse and inclusive tech sector. As the tech sector recognises the need for greater diversity, 
            equity, and inclusion, this is becoming more and more significant. As a result, I don't think the 
            time spent on core learning was a waste. Instead, it was an investment in my future as a programmer 
            both personally and professionally. The abilities I acquired through core learning will be useful 
            to me in all facets of my life, not just in my programming profession.
