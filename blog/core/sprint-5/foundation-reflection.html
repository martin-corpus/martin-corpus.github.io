          <h1>1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h1>
          <p>
            To be quite honest, during the core learning, I didn't learn anything new about myself or my ego. 
            I've studied extensively in the past, and what I already understand about myself is accurate. 
            It did, however, confirm my character as I know it to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy difficulties, to start. When I have to wait for the solution or cannot find it, it concerns me. 
            Knowing the answer is more important than bragging or demonstrating my ability to complete the task. 
            Even if someone shows it to me, I don't mind as long as I can resolve the situation mentally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, I'm very careful with my time. I'll put in a lot of effort to achieve a personal goal that I 
            set for myself to complete a particular challenge. Naturally, I had already factored work time for 
            breaks and personal time while calculating this. But I don't mind going above and above to make it 
            happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            And last, I enjoy my independence. I enjoy having the freedom to discuss concepts with myself as I 
            mull over a problem. This might discourage some individuals from trying to plan with me because I 
            have a tendency to think tangentially hehe.
