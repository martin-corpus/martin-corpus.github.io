        <section>
          <h1>1. What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
          <p>
            Currently, my long-term objective is the same as it was in Foundations. 
            To begin with, I want a job as a web developer. Although I have already 
            considered various other disciplines like BA and UX/UI. But I still need to 
            have some web development experience. I'm also willing to consider the 
            possibility that, after working in the tech sector, I might discover 
            something new that might direct me down a different road.
          </p>
          <p>
            The impact I want to make is convincing employers that I'm worth hiring. 
            I want my first employer to see how valuable I will be to the business. 
            Wherever I go, I want my future employers to notice that I am an asset.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would say I don't have a destination in mind pertaining to a specific business. 
            Currently, I am not picky. Yes, if the destination is related to the location. 
            Australia comes to mind simply because it is nearby and offers more 
            opportunities. However, working remotely is the actual dream. Having the 
            opportunity to work and travel would be amazing.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h1>2. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h1>
          <p>
            My perception of my weaknesses and strengths from Foundations has not altered and 
            is still the same. I didn't find any new ones, either. I didn't go into as much 
            detail back then, but I will now.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think my strengths will serve me well during Bootcamp because I'm curious, 
            I enjoy challenges, I'm methodical, and I'm strong with time management. 
            I'm also not concerned about cooperating with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, I did admit that I am easily sidetracked by simple or 
            dull subjects. Since Bootcamp will be intense and fast-paced, I don't believe 
            this will prevent me from making progress. 
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1>3. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h1>
          <p>
            The pair programming and group work I will be doing in Bootcamp will probably be my 
            largest non-technical difficulty. I have no trouble interacting with people, and 
            I'm good in a group setting. I believe the challenge would be coordinating my thoughts 
            with my partner or group members. I'm still learning about the subject matter, so it will 
            be interesting to see how we handle a specific issue. Additionally, because 
            everyone of us has a varied level of knowledge, there is a good chance that some of us 
            will become even more perplexed.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1>4. What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
          <p>
            Similar to Foundations, the non-technical/human skills I want to improve are teaching and 
            aiding my peers. This may function best in a group or pairing, I suppose. In addition 
            to someone needing my assistance, I would like to hone this talent so that I can better 
            understand the problem at hand, how to solve it, and most importantly how to convey it to 
            someone else so that they fully comprehend it. When I am able to communicate complexities 
            to someone and they understand it, I discover that my retention for information is better.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h1>5. What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h1>
          <p>
            My expectations from the Bootcamp staff are probably the same as how we were guided through 
            Foundations. Due to the intensity of the Bootcamp, I've been told that facilitators 
            will be more accessible at that time. I won't say no to more even though I am currently 
            content with the assistance.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1>6. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h1>
          <p>
            I have a lot of expectations for myself. I am prepared to complete and persevere through the 
            hardships I will face during Bootcamp. I'll ask for assistance if I get stuck for too long. 
            As far as I'm aware, we contact our direct facilitator via Discord for any assistance. 
            Keeping in mind to provide comprehensive information regarding the issue at hand and what 
            we have already done to address it. We can use the support desk channel if they are not 
            accessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am committed to managing my workload effectively to meet my learning objectives while 
            safeguarding my own safety as well as the safety of my peers and facilitators. I'll use 
            the following tactics to do this:
          </p>
          <p>
            Create a schedule: I will create a schedule that allocates specific times for coursework, 
            practice, and any other necessary activities. This will help me manage my time effectively 
            and ensure that I am making steady progress towards my goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Set realistic goals: I will set realistic goals that are achievable within the given 
            timeframe. This will help me avoid feeling overwhelmed and demotivated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take regular breaks: I will take regular breaks to refresh my mind and avoid burnout. 
            This will help me stay productive and focused during my study sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communicate with peers and facilitators: I will communicate regularly with my peers and 
            facilitators to exchange ideas, ask for help, and receive feedback. This will help me to 
            understand different perspectives and approaches to problem-solving.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h1>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
          <p>My long term goal is to be employed as a web developer. From there, I will explore other areas of IT that would be more interesting to me or would suit me best. Taking into consideration my IT friends' advice, they mentioned me doing well as a business analyst.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h1>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h1>
          <p>My strength in learning is seeing it as a challenge and liking it. When there is an obstacle along the way, I do my best to research on how to solve it. I am also persistent enough to see it through.</p>
          <p>When it comes to limitations, I get easily distracted when the topic is easy or uninteresting to me. Although I am mature enough to know that any knowledge given can help you down the line.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h1>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
          <p>Teaching and helping my colleagues is what I want to develop. It makes it easier for me to learn and understand the subject matter because there is a problem to be resolved. Although I am a beginner as well so at the moment, being there for each other is enough.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="list">
          <h1>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.</li>
              <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The only commitment I focus on is time. I have sticked to a daily routine to do my studies, alloting a minimum amount of time per day. This is not to say that it cannot change. Adjustments are part of study and of work and I should be prepared for it. To add to this, I avoid overdoing it as well that I am not in a state of calm. This will not only benefit me but also the people I work with.</p> 
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
          <p>When I feel that I am getting frustrated and I cannot find the answers I need, then I will ask for help. I usually give myself about half an hour to figure it out on my own. If I cannot then I message my home group and faciliatators.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>
          <p>With the untraditional way of learning, we are quite independent on how we approach our own education. The only thing I expect from the Facilitation team is their help when needed. This is quite evident for the past 2 weeks which is excellent!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h1>
          <p>The only personal schedule I have set at the moment is going to the gym everyday. I usually go mid-day when the gym is empty. In addition, this gives me a mental break inbetween study times. Anything other than that is usually unplanned. It is easy for me because of the flexibility of the study. I just work my way around those times to accomodate them without sacrificing my progress.</p>
