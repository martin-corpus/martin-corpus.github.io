          <h1>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
          <p>My long term goal is to be employed as a web developer. From there, I will explore other areas of IT that would be more interesting to me or would suit me best. Taking into consideration my IT friends' advice, they mentioned me doing well as a business analyst.</p>

          <h1>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h1>
          <p>My strength in learning is seeing it as a challenge and liking it. When there is an obstacle along the way, I do my best to research on how to solve it. I am also persistent enough to see it through.</p>
          <p>When it comes to limitations, I get easily distracted when the topic is easy or uninteresting to me. Although I am mature enough to know that any knowledge given can help you down the line.</p>

          <h1>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
          <p>Teaching and helping my colleagues is what I want to develop. It makes it easier for me to learn and understand the subject matter because there is a problem to be resolved. Although I am a beginner as well so at the moment, being there for each other is enough.</p>

        <section id="list">
          <h1>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.</li>
              <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The only commitment I focus on is time. I have sticked to a daily routine to do my studies, alloting a minimum amount of time per day. This is not to say that it cannot change. Adjustments are part of study and of work and I should be prepared for it. To add to this, I avoid overdoing it as well that I am not in a state of calm. This will not only benefit me but also the people I work with.</p>

        <section>
          <h1>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
          <p>When I feel that I am getting frustrated and I cannot find the answers I need, then I will ask for help. I usually give myself about half an hour to figure it out on my own. If I cannot then I message my home group and faciliatators.</p>

        <section>
          <h1>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>
          <p>With the untraditional way of learning, we are quite independent on how we approach our own education. The only thing I expect from the Facilitation team is their help when needed. This is quite evident for the past 2 weeks which is excellent!</p>

          <h1>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h1>
          <p>The only personal schedule I have set at the moment is going to the gym everyday. I usually go mid-day when the gym is empty. In addition, this gives me a mental break inbetween study times. Anything other than that is usually unplanned. It is easy for me because of the flexibility of the study. I just work my way around those times to accomodate them without sacrificing my progress.</p>
