# HTML & CSS Blog

This repo will be about building your blog using HTML and CSS while honing your GitHub and command line skills. 

You'll be learning HTML and CSS through online resources and applying what you learn to your blog website.

## Overview

In the last sprint, you set up your GitHub Pages blog (USERNAME.github.io). You'll be expanding this with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as you apply your learning throughout the sprints.

Your blog is a practical way to apply your learning and it will go towards your Foundations assessment. Take special note that you will not be judged on your design application. We don't mind what your blog looks like, but rather:

   + how you engaged with the material
   + the quality of your reflections
   + how you identified obstacles and overcame them
   + if you can demonstrate an understanding of the concepts and learning objectives; and
   + how frequently you engaged and staged commits.
   

**What your Blog is:** A space where you demonstrate your skills in problem-solving and reflections.

**What your Blog is not:** A fancy looking, perfectly put together interface.

We will, however, introduce you to the important aspects of design thinking and hope that you can incorporate those into your blog.

Throughout the sprints, you'll be presented with many ways to learn HTML, CSS, and JS building blocks.

Some of the resources we point you towards will be media-rich with audio and video. Others, like freeCodeCamp, will look more like a code editor and terminal window.
